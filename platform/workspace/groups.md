# Groups

Your workspace can be configured with groups of members. We plan to expand usage of groups, but currently, groups can be used during [user identification](../../using-wayscript/sdk/example-identify-requester-to-protected-endpoints.md).&#x20;

### Viewing groups

Navigate to Settings > Groups to view a list of groups in your workspace. Each group has an owner and can have up to **50** members. &#x20;

### Creating groups

Select "New Group" to create to a group. You will be assigned the group owner and you can add active workspace members to your group.&#x20;
