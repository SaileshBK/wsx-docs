# Alerts

Your Lairs can be configured to generate email alerts on the following process conditions:

* `Success` - process has exited with "Done" status&#x20;
* `Fail` - process has exited with "Failed" status
* `Any` -  process has exited with any status, including "Done", "Killed", or "Failed"

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that alerts will be generated on process exit and not on process start and will only be generated in your Lair's production environment. Please see [processes.md](../testing-and-visiblity/processes.md "mention") for more details on process status and [deployments.md](../building-tools/deployments.md "mention") for instructions on how to deploy your Lair to its production environment.&#x20;

Alerts can be composed with the following parameters:

* **On** - select process condition to generate alert from options identifed above
* **Alert** - choose the member of workspace to alert
* **Frequency -** limit the volume of alerts by selecting options "once a hour" or "once a day"; otherwise all alerts will be generated by option "always"
* **Trigger** (optional) - select a specific trigger, by name, where only its invoked processes will generate alerts; otherwise all processes in the Lair will generate alerts

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you create a new alert or modify an alert, you must re-deploy your Lair to its production environment for the changes to take effect. Please see [deployments.md](../building-tools/deployments.md "mention")for more details on how to re-deploy.&#x20;
