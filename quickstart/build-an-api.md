# Build an API

WayScript X allows you to configure your Lair to build an API endpoint in minutes.

### Create `api.py`

Use the boilerplate code below to create an `api.py` file in your Lair’s root directory. See [File system](https://coda.io/d/WayScript-X-Docs_d2kDMDaZ6QP/File-system_sua4L) for more details on how to manipulate files in your workspace file system.  
\[add file menu\]

#### Boilerplate `api.py`

```python
# my-lair-a > api.py

from wayscript.triggers import http_trigger

payload = {"hello": "world"}
headers = {"content-type": "application/json"}
status_code = 200

http_trigger.send_response(data=payload, headers=headers, status_code=status_code)
```

### Configure `http` trigger

Open your Lair’s `.triggers` file and add a new `http` trigger. Create a name for your trigger and input the following run command. See [Triggers](https://coda.io/d/WayScript-X-Docs_d2kDMDaZ6QP/Triggers_suAFX) for more details.

```bash
$ python api.py
```

### “Push” your files to remote

Press “Push” to sync your new and modified files to remote \(see [File system](https://coda.io/d/WayScript-X-Docs_d2kDMDaZ6QP/File-system_sua4L) for more details\).  
\[Push button\]

### Test your API in development environment

Navigate to the `*.wayscript.cloud` endpoint generated by your `http` trigger to see your simple API in action!

### Deploy to production environment

Once you have finished testing, press “Deploy” to create a production environment for your API. Select `<Lair_name>.prod` in the Lair selector menu and view the `http` trigger to access your API’s production endpoint. See [Hosted environments](https://coda.io/d/WayScript-X-Docs_d2kDMDaZ6QP/Hosted-environments_suwGe) for more details.
