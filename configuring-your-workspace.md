# Configuring your workspace

Your **workspace** is the root directory that contains all your tools that live on WayScript. Your workspace allows you to create and delete [Lairs](building-tools/lairs.md), the basic building block of WayScript, and manage team members.&#x20;

### Setting up your workspace

#### **Creating a workspace**

You can create a new workspace after registering your account with WayScript X. When using the WayScript X desktop app, you will then be directory to choose a workspace folder (see [File system](building-tools/file-system.md) for more details).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Workspace names must be unique. Please modify the name of your workspace if you cannot create one.
{% endhint %}

#### **Leaving a workspace**

Navigate to your workspace settings if you would like to leave your workspace. You must be part of a workspace to use WayScript X, so after leaving, you will be redirected to create or join a workspace.

#### **Joining a workspace**

If you have been invited to any existing workspaces, you can join the specified workspace instead of creating a a new one. Currently, you can only be a member of one workspace; you must leave your current workspace to join a new one.

### Inviting a team member to your workspace

Navigate to your workspace settings to invite a team member by email address to your workspace. Your team member must register an account using the email address specified in the invite.
