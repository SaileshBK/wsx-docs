# Auto-Sync

Working in the desktop app gives you the ability to autosync your WayScript cloud environments with your local machine. Develop locally as usual using your preferred IDE and tools. Changes will automatically sync to your Lair and update your hosted endpoints in real time. You'll be able to test your changes in real time. No more waiting for frameworks or servers to spin up locally. &#x20;
