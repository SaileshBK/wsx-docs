# What is WayScript X?

WayScript X is a platform for **Instant Containers In The Cloud** that allows devs to focus on writing code instead of managing infrastructure. Common use cases include setting up internal API services, hosting Flask apps, and executing scripts via cron / other triggers.â€Œ

With WayScript X, you can unblock data access by quickly turning database queries into secure REST API routes for your team or customers. You can also build interfaces for non-technical teams. Each container is hosted in a dedicated, pre-configured environment \(managed by WayScript or self-hosted\), deployed with a single click, and pre-built with granular permission controls.

WayScript X is currently in closed beta release. To request early access, please email our team at [nihar@wayscript.com](mailto:nihar@wayscript.com).
