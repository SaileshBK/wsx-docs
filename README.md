# What is WayScript?

WayScript is a development hub for internal tools. WayScript provides **instant, cloud-hosted containers** to allow developers to focus on writing code instead of managing infrastructure. Common use cases include setting up internal microservices, hosting full-fledged apps, and executing scripts via cron / other triggers.â€Œ

Each container is managed in a dedicated, pre-configured environment (managed by WayScript or self-hosted), deployed with a single click, and pre-built with monitoring and permission controls.&#x20;

With WayScript, you can unblock data access by quickly turning database queries into secure REST API routes for your team or customers. You can set up batch data migrations to run asynchronously. You can even build interfaces for non-technical teams. The possibilities are endless!
