# What is WayScript?

WayScript is a platform for **Instant Containers In The Cloud** that allows devs to focus on writing code instead of managing infrastructure. Common use cases include setting up internal API services, hosting Flask apps, and executing scripts via cron / other triggers.â€Œ

With WayScript, you can unblock data access by quickly turning database queries into secure REST API routes for your team or customers. You can also build interfaces for non-technical teams. Each container is hosted in a dedicated, pre-configured environment (managed by WayScript or self-hosted), deployed with a single click, and pre-built with granular permission controls.

WayScript is currently in alpha release, so you may encounter small issues as we continue our development of the platform. Please subscribe to our [blog](https://blog.wayscript.com) and join our Discord [server](https://discord.gg/SEAPQnCTpp) for continuing updates. We greatly appreciate your feedback and support!
