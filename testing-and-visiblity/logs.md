# Logs

As your process executes, WayScript generates a log file that captures the StdOutput and StdError to give you full visibility while testing your tools.

### Viewing process logs

Your process logs can be accessed by selecting a row in the process list (see [Processes](processes.md) for how to view your processes), which will open a tab next to your Lairâ€™s terminal window.

#### **Running processes**

Your Lair editor will fetch a live stream of log entries for running processes. However, your process logs are stored as static files, so please allow for a few seconds delay between log creation and display in your process log.

#### **Closed or failed processes**

You can also open your process logs for closed or failed processes. By default, your logs will be stored for **7 days**, but please reach out to us at [support@wayscript.com](mailto:support@wayscript.com) if you are interested in additional log retention.
